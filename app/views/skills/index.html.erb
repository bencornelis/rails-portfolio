    I'm currently attending Epicodus, a web development bootcamp where I am learning test-driven development though pair-programming. Previously, a life-long love of puzzles, logic, and problem-solving drove me to pursue a phd in Mathematics. While I enjoyed the process of problem solving involved in abstract math, I was unsatisfied by the lack of real-world impact. I decided to become a web developer because it allows me to build something useful and tangible using many of the same skills.
